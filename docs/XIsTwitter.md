# X is Twitter.
Copyright (C) 2025 Takym.

## Rules
0. X is Twitter because Twitter is renamed to X.
1. Ten or 10 is Twitter because its Roman number is X.
2. The kanji "十" is Twitter because it means 10.
3. The addition symbol "+" is Twitter because it looks like "十".
4. The multiplication symbol "$\times$" is Twitter because it looks like X.
5. The asterisk mark "*" is Twitter because it is used as multiplication in some programming languages.
6. In the Twitter context, addition and multiplication are completely the same thing.
